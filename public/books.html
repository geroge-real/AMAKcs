            <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
            <h3> Jane Austen - Published 1796 </h3>
       
            <p>It centres on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman and the novel’s heroine, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, an aristocratic landowner. It is set in rural England at the turn of the 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which 
              includes five very different sisters, all of whom their mother is keen to see suitably married. The intersections of these sisters with several eligible bachelors drive the action of the novel. Despite initial friction between them, Elizabeth eventually accepts Darcy’s proposal of marriage (Britannica, 2021). </p>

            <h2>1984</h2>
            <h3> George Orwell - Published 1949 </h3>
           
            <p>1984, first published in 1948, is based on a dystopian vision of the future where the freedom of the individual is subjugated to the conformity of society. The novel focuses on Winston Smith, who works for the Ministry of Truth, a branch of the government responsible for 
              the dissemination of information. Each day begins for all citizens with a Two Minutes’ Hate session, which promotes fear and paranoia in order to ensure that people follow the wishes of Big Brother. In this world, children act as spies on parents, party members work for 
              terrible food and housing, and all individuality is washed way under the constant, ever­present gaze of Big Brother. As the novel unfolds, it becomes apparent that Winston Smith is unhappy with his life. He finds a girl, Julia, who shares his desire for a more meaningful life. 
              Smith’s revolt against society will eventually bring him eye to eye with Big Brother, when he must decide if he truly loves Julia, freedom, or Big Brother (Lowne, 2025)</p>

            <h2>The Scarlet Letter</h2>
            <h3> Nathaniel Hawthorne - Published 1850 </h3>
           
            <p>The Scarlet Letter is set in a village in Puritan New England. The main character is Hester Prynne, a young woman who has borne a child, Pearl, out of wedlock. Hester believes herself a widow, but her husband, Roger Chillingsworth, returns to New England very much alive and conceals his identity. 
              He finds his wife forced to wear the scarlet letter A on her dress as punishment for her adultery. Chillingsworth becomes obsessed with finding the identity of his wife’s former lover. When he learns that the father of Prynne’s child is Arthur Dimmesdale, a saintly young minister who is the leader of those 
              pressuring Prynne to name the child’s father, Chillingsworth proceeds to torment the guilt-stricken young man. In the end Chillingsworth is morally degraded by his relentless pursuit of revenge. Dimmesdale is broken by his own sense of guilt, and he publicly confesses his adultery before dying in Prynne’s arms. 
              Only Prynne can face the future bravely, as she plans to take her daughter to Europe to begin a new life (Mcdonald, 2025).</p>

            <h3> Harper Lee - Published 1960 </h3>
            
            <p>To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee. Although it was written in 1960 it is set in the mid-1930s in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama. It is narrated by Scout Finch, a six-year-old tomboy who lives with her lawyer father Atticus and her ten-year-old brother Jem. During the novel Scout, Jem and their friend Dill 
              try to make their reclusive neighbour Boo Radley leave his house. Boo has not been seen in Maycomb since he was a teenager. Many residents of Maycomb are racistsand during the novel Atticus is asked to defend Tom Robinson, a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman. Atticus takes on the case even though everyone knows 
              he has little hope of winning. The reader sees the trial develop through the childlike eyes of Scout, as gradually both she and her brother learn some valuable life lessons from their father about tolerance, empathy and understanding (Fine, 2024). </p>

            <h2>The Catcher in the Rye</h2>
            <h3> JD Salinger - Published 1951 </h3>
                        <p>It's Christmas time and Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another school. Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. 
              The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning. The Catcher in 
              the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind (Lhones, 2025). </p>

             <h2> Crime and Punishment</h2>
             <h3> Fyodor Dostoyevsky - Published 1866 </h3>
                        <p>Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, 
               and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of "extraordinary" men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is 
              confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed (Cregan, 2024). </p>
