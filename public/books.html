            <h3> Jane Austen - Published 1796 </h3>
       
            <p>It centres on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman and the novel’s heroine, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, an aristocratic landowner. It is set in rural England at the turn of the 19th century, and it follows the Bennet family, which 
              includes five very different sisters, all of whom their mother is keen to see suitably married. The intersections of these sisters with several eligible bachelors drive the action of the novel. Despite initial friction between them, Elizabeth eventually accepts Darcy’s proposal of marriage (Britannica, 2021). </p>

            <h3> George Orwell - Published 1949 </h3>
           
            <p>1984, first published in 1948, is based on a dystopian vision of the future where the freedom of the individual is subjugated to the conformity of society. The novel focuses on Winston Smith, who works for the Ministry of Truth, a branch of the government responsible for 
              the dissemination of information. Each day begins for all citizens with a Two Minutes’ Hate session, which promotes fear and paranoia in order to ensure that people follow the wishes of Big Brother. In this world, children act as spies on parents, party members work for 
              terrible food and housing, and all individuality is washed way under the constant, ever­present gaze of Big Brother. As the novel unfolds, it becomes apparent that Winston Smith is unhappy with his life. He finds a girl, Julia, who shares his desire for a more meaningful life. 
              Smith’s revolt against society will eventually bring him eye to eye with Big Brother, when he must decide if he truly loves Julia, freedom, or Big Brother (Lowne, 2025)</p>

            <h3> Nathaniel Hawthorne - Published 1850 </h3>
           
            <p>The Scarlet Letter is set in a village in Puritan New England. The main character is Hester Prynne, a young woman who has borne a child, Pearl, out of wedlock. Hester believes herself a widow, but her husband, Roger Chillingsworth, returns to New England very much alive and conceals his identity. 
              He finds his wife forced to wear the scarlet letter A on her dress as punishment for her adultery. Chillingsworth becomes obsessed with finding the identity of his wife’s former lover. When he learns that the father of Prynne’s child is Arthur Dimmesdale, a saintly young minister who is the leader of those 
              pressuring Prynne to name the child’s father, Chillingsworth proceeds to torment the guilt-stricken young man. In the end Chillingsworth is morally degraded by his relentless pursuit of revenge. Dimmesdale is broken by his own sense of guilt, and he publicly confesses his adultery before dying in Prynne’s arms. 
              Only Prynne can face the future bravely, as she plans to take her daughter to Europe to begin a new life (Mcdonald, 2025).</p>

            <h2>The Catcher in the Rye</h2>
            <h3> JD Salinger - Published 1951 </h3>
                        <p>It's Christmas time and Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from yet another school. Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels, wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. 
              The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning. The Catcher in 
              the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind (Lhones, 2025). </p>

             <h3> Fyodor Dostoyevsky - Published 1866 </h3>
                        <p>Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, 
               and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of "extraordinary" men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is 
              confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed (Cregan, 2024). </p>

This painting captures the beauty of a young man named Dorian Gray, who has had a profound effect on Basil. When Dorian himself arrives, he's captivated by Lord Henry's philosophical musings on life and beauty.
                        As time goes on, Dorian becomes obsessed with the idea of staying young forever. He wishes that his portrait would age instead of him. His wish seems to come true, but as he indulges in a life of pleasure and excess, the portrait reflects his inner corruption while he remains outwardly unchanged (McDonald, 2025). </p>

             <h2> Great Expectations</h2>
             <h3> Charles Dickens - Published 1861 </h3>
                        <p> Great Expectations follows the childhood and young adult years of Pip a blacksmith's apprentice in a country village. He suddenly comes into a large fortune (his great expectations) from a mysterious benefactor and moves to London where he enters high society. He thinks he knows where the money has come from but he turns out to be sadly mistaken. The story also follows 
                            Pip's dealings with Estella, a young woman he adores but who cannot return his love (Pfeiffer, 2024).  </p>

             <h2> Lolita</h2>
             <h3> Vladimir Nabokov - Published 1955 </h3>
                        <p> In early adolescence, Humbert fell hopelessly and tragically in love with a girl his own age, and, as he grew into adulthood, he never lost his obsession with "nymphets," teenagers who walk a fine line between being a girl and a woman. While looking for a place to live after securing a new teaching position, he meets Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), a pretentious and annoying woman 
                            who seems desperately lonely and is obviously attracted to Humbert. Humbert pays her little mind until he meets her 13-year-old daughter Lolita (Dominique Swain), the image of the girl that Humbert once loved. Humbert moves into the Haze home as a boarder and eventually marries Charlotte in order to be closer to Lolita. When Charlotte finds out about Humbert's attraction to her daughter, 
                            she flees the house in a rage, only to be killed in an auto accident. Without telling Lolita of her mother's fate, Humbert takes her on a cross-country auto trip, where their relationship begins to move beyond the traditional boundaries of stepfather and step-daughter (Field, 2024). </p>

             <h2> Brave New World</h2>
             <h3> Aldous Huxley - Published 1932 </h3>
                        <p> The novel is set in A.F. 632, approximately seven centuries after the twentieth century. A.F. stands for the year of Ford, named for the great industrialist Henry Ford who refined mass production techniques for automobiles. World Controllers rule the world and ensure the stability of society through the creation of a five-tiered caste system. Alphas and Betas are at the top of the system and 
                            act as the scientists, politicians, and other top minds, while Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons are at the bottom and represent the world's industrial working class. A drug called soma ensures that no one ever feels pain or remains unhappy, and members of every caste receive rations of the drug. Pre- and post-natal conditioning further ensures social stability (Lohnes, 2025). </p>
