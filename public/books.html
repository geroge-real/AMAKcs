            <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>
            <h3>Jane Austen - Published 1796</h3>

            <p>
              It centres on the burgeoning relationship between Elizabeth
              Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman and the novel’s
              heroine, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, an aristocratic landowner. It is
              set in rural England at the turn of the 19th century, and it
              follows the Bennet family, which includes five very different
              sisters, all of whom their mother is keen to see suitably married.
              The intersections of these sisters with several eligible bachelors
              drive the action of the novel. Despite initial friction between
              them, Elizabeth eventually accepts Darcy’s proposal of marriage
              (Britannica, 2021).

            <h2>1984</h2>
            <h3>George Orwell - Published 1949</h3>

            <p>
              1984, first published in 1948, is based on a dystopian vision of
              the future where the freedom of the individual is subjugated to
              the conformity of society. The novel focuses on Winston Smith, who
              works for the Ministry of Truth, a branch of the government
              responsible for the dissemination of information. Each day begins
              for all citizens with a Two Minutes’ Hate session, which promotes
              fear and paranoia in order to ensure that people follow the wishes
              of Big Brother. In this world, children act as spies on parents,
              party members work for terrible food and housing, and all
              individuality is washed way under the constant, ever­present gaze
              of Big Brother. As the novel unfolds, it becomes apparent that
              Winston Smith is unhappy with his life. He finds a girl, Julia,
              who shares his desire for a more meaningful life. Smith’s revolt
              against society will eventually bring him eye to eye with Big
              Brother, when he must decide if he truly loves Julia, freedom, or
              Big Brother (Lowne, 2025)

            <h2>The Scarlet Letter</h2>
            <h3>Nathaniel Hawthorne - Published 1850</h3>

            <p>
              The Scarlet Letter is set in a village in Puritan New England. The
              main character is Hester Prynne, a young woman who has borne a
              child, Pearl, out of wedlock. Hester believes herself a widow, but
              her husband, Roger Chillingsworth, returns to New England very
              much alive and conceals his identity. He finds his wife forced to
              wear the scarlet letter A on her dress as punishment for her
              adultery. Chillingsworth becomes obsessed with finding the
              identity of his wife’s former lover. When he learns that the
              father of Prynne’s child is Arthur Dimmesdale, a saintly young
              minister who is the leader of those pressuring Prynne to name the
              child’s father, Chillingsworth proceeds to torment the
              guilt-stricken young man. In the end Chillingsworth is morally
              degraded by his relentless pursuit of revenge. Dimmesdale is
              broken by his own sense of guilt, and he publicly confesses his
              adultery before dying in Prynne’s arms. Only Prynne can face the
              future bravely, as she plans to take her daughter to Europe to
              begin a new life (Mcdonald, 2025).

            <h2>The Catcher in the Rye</h2>
            <h3>JD Salinger - Published 1951</h3>
            <p>
              It's Christmas time and Holden Caulfield has just been expelled
              from yet another school. Fleeing the crooks at Pencey Prep, he
              pinballs around New York City seeking solace in fleeting
              encounters—shooting the bull with strangers in dive hotels,
              wandering alone round Central Park, getting beaten up by pimps and
              cut down by erstwhile girlfriends. The city is beautiful and
              terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its
              mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through
              it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the
              only person who really understands him, and his determination to
              escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning. The Catcher in
              the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an
              elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for
              connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood
              behind (Lhones, 2025).

            <h3>Fyodor Dostoyevsky - Published 1866</h3>
            <p>
              Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas
              of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint
              Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old
              woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He
              theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from
              poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince
              himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed
              in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of
              "extraordinary" men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds
              himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His
              theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles
              with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and
              external consequences of his deed (Cregan, 2024).

              Widely acknowledged as Gabriel García Márquez’s finest work, One
              Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the fictional
              Colombian town Macondo and the rise and fall of its founders, the
              Buendía family. Revealed through intriguing temporal folds,
              characters inherit the names and dispositions of their family,
              unfolding patterns that double and recur. The mighty José Arcadio
              Buendía goes from intrepid, charismatic founder of Macondo to a
              madman on its fringes. Macondo fights off plagues of insomnia,
              war, and rain (Milne, 2024).

              After a series of epigrams highlighting Wilde's aesthetic

              showing off his latest masterpiece to his friend Lord Henry

              Animal Farm by George Orwell, first published in 1945, is a
              satirical allegory that explores the Russian Revolution and the
              subsequent rise of Stalinism. Set on a farm, the story begins with
              the animals overthrowing their human oppressors, led by the pigs
              who represent the ruling class. Initially, the animals establish a
              utopian society based on the principles of equality and
              solidarity. However, as the pigs consolidate power, they betray
              the very ideals they espoused, turning the farm into a dystopian
              regime mirroring the oppressive human rule they initially rebelled
              against (Woodcock, 2025).

              human nature. Dr Jekyll is a kind, well-respected and intelligent
              scientist who meddles with the darker side of science, as he wants
              to bring out his 'second' nature. He does this through
              transforming himself into Mr Hyde - his evil alter ego who doesn't
              repent or accept responsibility for his evil crimes and ways.
              Jekyll tries to control his alter ego, Hyde, and for a while,
              Jekyll has the power. However, towards the end of the novel, Hyde
              takes over and this results in their deaths (Lebeau, 2025).

            <h3>Vladimir Nabokov - Published 1955</h3>
            <p>
              In early adolescence, Humbert fell hopelessly and tragically in
              love with a girl his own age, and, as he grew into adulthood, he
              never lost his obsession with "nymphets," teenagers who walk a
              fine line between being a girl and a woman. While looking for a
              place to live after securing a new teaching position, he meets
              Charlotte Haze (Melanie Griffith), a pretentious and annoying
              woman who seems desperately lonely and is obviously attracted to
              Humbert. Humbert pays her little mind until he meets her
              13-year-old daughter Lolita (Dominique Swain), the image of the
              girl that Humbert once loved. Humbert moves into the Haze home as
              a boarder and eventually marries Charlotte in order to be closer
              to Lolita. When Charlotte finds out about Humbert's attraction to
              her daughter, she flees the house in a rage, only to be killed in
              an auto accident. Without telling Lolita of her mother's fate,
              Humbert takes her on a cross-country auto trip, where their
              relationship begins to move beyond the traditional boundaries of
              stepfather and step-daughter (Field, 2024).

              the great industrialist Henry Ford who refined mass production
              techniques for automobiles. World Controllers rule the world and
              ensure the stability of society through the creation of a
              five-tiered caste system. Alphas and Betas are at the top of the
              system and act as the scientists, politicians, and other top
              minds, while Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons are at the bottom and
              represent the world's industrial working class. A drug called soma
              ensures that no one ever feels pain or remains unhappy, and
              members of every caste receive rations of the drug. Pre- and
              post-natal conditioning further ensures social stability (Lohnes,

              of boys stranded after their plane crashes. Initially, the boys

            <h3>Ernest Hemingway - Published 1952</h3>
            <p>
              The Old Man and the Sea was Ernest Hemingway's last written novel
              before he committed suicide. Revered by many and still taught in
              schools today, Hemingway's short novel describes the struggle of a
              fisherman trying to redeem himself by catching a large fish to
              show to the community. (Smith, 2025).

            <h2>The Stranger</h2>
            <h3>Albert Camus - Published 1942</h3>
            <p>
              Written by Albert Camus in 1942, The Stranger tells the story of
              the assassination of an Arab man who is never named. This story
              demonstrates the depths of human apathy as the main character,
              Meursault, is put on trial for the murder of the man. (Lowne,
              2025).

            <h2>Of Mice And Men</h2>
            <h3>John Steinback - Published 1937</h3>
            <p>
              The story follows two migrant workers, George and Lennie, who
              begin working at a new ranch during the Great Depression and dream
              of owning a farm of their own. The main idea of Steinbeck's work
              is a statement of humanity as he investigates the meaning of
              humanity during the times of the Great Depression (Kristian,
              2017).
