**Aklatan Mo: Aklatan Ko ðŸ“š - Your Personal Novel System**

Aklatan Mo: Aklatan Ko (AMAK) is a bookworm's personal organization website that aims 
to advocate for literacy, especially among the youth, and make reading more accessible.
The system allows the user to search an array of clickable books that will take them
to a separate webpage with the book's information, including other reader's critiques
and comments on them. 

The system features the website's About Us statement and what it aims to do,
core values, team members, and other services and offerings. It will also show a simple 
editable profile page for the user's information, such as their username, favorite books,
and profile picture. Similar to Facebook and Instagram, we wish this program to be a
social networking app that also allows the user to connect with other bibliophiles and
create posts to share with others.
