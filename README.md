**Aklatan Mo: Aklatan Ko ðŸ“š - Your Personal Novel System**

Aklatan Mo: Aklatan Ko (AMAK) is a bookworm's personal organization website that aims 
to advocate for literacy, especially among the youth, and make reading more accessible.
The system allows the user to search an array of clickable books that will take them
to a separate webpage with the book's information, including other reader's critiques
and comments on them. 

The system features the website's About Us statement and what it aims to do,
core values, team members, and other services and offerings. It will also show a simple 
editable profile page for the user's information, such as their username, favorite books,
and profile picture. Similar to Facebook and Instagram, we wish this program to be a
social networking app that also allows the user to connect with other bibliophiles and
create posts to share with others.

**Javascript Description**: 
This project is a book information website designed to showcase 
popular books and allow users to search for and save their favorite books. The website uses 
Javascript to enhance its functionality. The main functions implementing Javascript are
making the search bar work to filter out books that don't have the keywords the user typed, 
a collapsible menu, and profile section where users can edit and save (even when reloaded!).

This website is a book library website where people can search for books, rate, read, and leave 
comments. The website includes a collapsible menu to navigate different sections: Home, Profile, 
and About Us. People using this website can save profile information, which is stored locally. 
The menu button triggers navigation to different pages based on user input, allowing access to 
book data and social media content. The javascript code manages the search bar functionality, menu, 
and profile data storage.

4TH QUARTER UPDATES
**Updates Done to include Persistent Data (Designing New Login and 
Sign-Up Page, User Profile Management Page):** 
We want to improve users' login and account creation and make signing up simple and hassle-free.
Users joining from a foreign device can easily log in to their existing account by providing their username (or email address) and password.
If any information is forgotten, users can click a hyperlink for a verification code to reset or recover it.
If a user has yet to make an account, they can quickly sign up for AMAK by entering their email, first and last name, and password. 

To improve account management features, users can click Edit Profile to change their account details and see the information publicly displayed.
They can also save their changes by clicking the Save Changes button and updating their account in real-time.
These changes are stored in the user's account and can be accessed by others.
Users can also delete an account by clicking the Delete Account button, which leads to a confirmation prompt.
